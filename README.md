# Ultra-Document-Search
my final year project
first commit

Abstract:
The purpose of Ultra Document Search (UDS) is to reduce overhead of user while doing search in content of files which are in a bulk.
We usually search for a word or sentence in the content of files. To perform search we need to open every file and do find. It takes time to open and search in every file. We want to simplify this task by reducing overhead for user. This application takes input as a directory and a search word and performs search within the content of files, which are residing in the target directory. As a result, it displays hyperlinks to the files which are containing search word within it. It can search within files of sub-directories and sub-sub-directories as well.
